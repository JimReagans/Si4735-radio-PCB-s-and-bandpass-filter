Si4735 radio and bandpass filter
The radio is a copy of Ricardo Carratti's high effective Si4735 radio with an OLED.  The Gerbers and BOM make it easy to fabricate this radio, although the Si4735 is difficult 
solder due to the pin spacing and the caps and resistors are 0603 size.
The bandpass filter set is also a revised version of Ricardo Carratti's and SoftRock's filter set.   All in a 1.25 x 2.75" circuit board. You can use all 4 sections to provide 
effective filters for the 80 through 10 meter bands. You can skip the lowest filter set and just use a jumper, to allow AM or FM, if desired.  The band switching can be done 
with 2 spare pins on your processor.
